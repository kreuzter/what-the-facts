Is leek the same as a spring onion? And what about shallots?

Let's start with a bit of biology and etymology. All these bulbs fall under the genus *Allium* (Latin for garlic). Along with them, this includes chives and - not surprisingly - garlic. The Dutch term for the genus *Allium* is in turn derived from leek (*Look*).

However, these are different species of plants. In terms of taxonomy, the leek is related to the onion in the same way that the lion is related to the tiger. Both belong to the genus *Panthera* (Latin for panthers) and yes, just as garlic belongs to *Allium*, panthers belong to Panthera.

Leek is considered one of the national emblems of Wales. It is supposedly mentioned in the Old Testament and was also liked by Emperor Nero.

The names spring onion (scallion) and shallot both refer to the Middle Eastern city of Ascalon. This is explained by the fact that some species of the genus Allium were brought to Europe as part of the Crusades.

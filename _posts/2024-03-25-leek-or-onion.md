Is leek the same as a spring onion? And what about shallots?

Let's start with a bit of biology and etymology. All these bulbs fall under the genus [*Allium*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allium) (Latin for garlic). Along with them, this includes chives and - not surprisingly - garlic. The Dutch term for the genus *Allium* is in turn derived from leek (*Look*).

However, these are different species of plants. In terms of taxonomy, the leek is related to the onion in the same way that the lion is related to the tiger. Both the cats belong to the genus [*Panthera*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthera) and yes, just as garlic belongs to *Allium*, black panther belongs to *Panthera*.

Leek is also quite interesting from cultural point of view. It is considered one of the [national symbols of Wales](https://www.wales.com/about/culture/national-symbols-wales), is supposedly [mentioned in the Old Testament](https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionary/leeks/) together with onions and garlic and [it is said](https://www.britishleeks.co.uk/leeks-a-short-history/) that Emperor Nero liked leek so much, he gained the nickname Porophagus (leek eater).

The names scallion and shallot both refer to the Middle Eastern city of Ascalon. This is explained by the fact that some species of the genus *Allium* were brought to Europe as part of the Crusades.

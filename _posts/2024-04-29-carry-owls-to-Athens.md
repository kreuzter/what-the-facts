Sometimes people do completely useless things. And other people then try to compare the degree of uselessness to something. They mostly do it through the "carry something somewhere" template. But what do we carry? And where? That mostly depends on where you are.

We probably got this template from the Greeks, they carried owls to Athens. The inland parts of Europe cary wood to the forest, and the coastal nations, on the other hand, carry water to the sea. The English are a bit different, they carry coal to Newcastle.
